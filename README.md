## [Creactive's SIGAA LUA](https://lua.creactive.com.br) ##

### The problem ###
[Universidade Federal do Ceará](http://ufc.br) has a system for its students to enroll into disciplines, check grades and other common academic tasks. This system is called [SIGAA](https://si3.ufc.br/). It works fairly well for its purpose. 

There is however a big catch. You must use [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) to be able to use it by the official means. This decision is hard to justify on technical grounds, as SIGAA works with no to small problems with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), [Opera](https://www.opera.com) or even older versions of Internet Explorer (not linking this one, please use a modern browser).

### The solution ###
This is a tiny and simple HTML/CSS/JS project that allows students to use any browser they want to access UFC's SIGAA, even on mobile platforms. It's hosted on GitHub pages. You can access it via [https://lua.creactive.com.br](https://lua.creactive.com.br).

### Development ###
This project was created by [Bruno Saboia de Albuquerque](https://github.com/brunosaboia) while a member of [LUA - Livre União Acadêmica](http://caeco.org), the student's directory for Economics at UFC.


### Licensing ###
If you plan to host this, please do not remove Creactive's nor LUA references. You may however change them to suit your needs, as long as they remain visible.
